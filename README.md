Smart Railway Issue Monitoring System

RailWatch is a lightweight, mobile-friendly web application that enables railway passengers to report issues, track complaint status, and allows authorities to manage and resolve issues efficiently — even in low-connectivity environments like trains.

 Problem Statement

Railway passengers often face issues such as:

Poor cleanliness in coaches

Broken facilities

Maintenance and safety concerns

Existing complaint systems are:

Slow

Non-transparent

Difficult to track

Passengers don’t know whether their complaint is being addressed or ignored.

 Solution

RailWatch converts unstructured passenger complaints into structured, trackable, and actionable data.

It provides:

A simple way to report issues with minimal steps

Transparent status tracking for passengers

A centralized dashboard for railway authorities

The application is designed using a frontend-first approach to validate user experience before backend integration.
